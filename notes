This is the week one project for our ruby specialization.
I will be putting notes on what I am thinking or find when I google stuff.
I will still be commenting out stuff in the actual code this is just kinda for my sanity.
- In deck, make sure that all cards are unique with face and suit

ranks = %w{A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K}
suits = %w{Spades Hearts Diamonds Clubs}
suits.each do |suit|
  ranks.size.times do |i|
    stack_of_cards << Card.new( ranks[i], suit, i+1 )
  end
end

-------->>>>>>>>Game<<<<<<<<<___________

- Initial deal.
  > Player will get 2 cards at the start of the game
    \ If the total of those cards = 21 the player wins
    / If the total does not = 21 then the player is given the option to hit or stay.
  > The player will see both of their cards as well as one of the dealers cards and will continue until they get 21 bust or stay
